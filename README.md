## Description

This is a note taking app created in order to facilitate and ease the burden of remembering life's tasks. We all know how hard it can be to remember everything. Sometimes we need a little software help in making sure we keep up with Uncle Rick's birthday or Janie's piano lessons. This app aided me in cementing what I learned regarding how to build backend product via express and fs utilities.
